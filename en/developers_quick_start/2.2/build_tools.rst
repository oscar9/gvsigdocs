Build tools
===========

Everything to build version 2.2 of gvSIG was based on Maven. This tool is the official build tool of the project.

..  tip::
    It is recommended to read the Maven documentation in the gvSIG 2.0 *developer guide*, `section on "Maven" `_ where one can find a brief description as well as useful links to resources related to Maven.

Having adopted Maven has been great for the dependencies management and brought a series of best practices into the development process.

You can compile and deploy the project from command line without being bound to a particular *integrated development environment (IDE)*.

It is therefore important to know at least some minimal Maven functionality to develop around gvSIG.

Both *Netbeans* and *Eclipse* can be used for the development.

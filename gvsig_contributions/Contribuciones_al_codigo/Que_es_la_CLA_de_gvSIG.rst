The current gvSIG official projects copyright holder is the gvSIG Association. Any contribution to the gvSIG project requires to sign our contributor's agreement and send it by regular mail or by fax to gvSIG (this is an unfortunate consequence of copyright law in some jurisdictions). This requirement does not apply to external modules, localizations, documentation, except if they are contributed to us. It only applies to contributions that will be part of the core products.

The objective of contributor agreement is to protect the integrity of the
project, its users and developers. The contributor agreement transfers the
contributor's copyright to gvSIG who grants a non-exclusive license back to
allow the contributor to use his/her own work. The rationale behind the
agreement is:

#. In case of a legal claim, having a single copyright owner makes it easier to
   defend the interests of the gvSIG users and developers. The gvSIG
   Association is committed to defend gvSIG projects in the event of any
   claim or infringement by third parties.

#. The gvSIG Association can relicense its works under any other license in
   the future. When starting an open source project, the choice of license is
   intended to be permanent, but the experience of the past few years is that
   the ability to relicense a project is a useful tool in meeting challenges for
   open source projects. Not having that flexibility may be a drawback. Without
   the agreement, every single contributor must be contacted and unanimity
   reached in order to relicense a code base, or parts of the code must be
   reimplemented. This is true for all but the most permissively-licensed open
   source projects.

#. The contributors assert that their contributions are original and not
   protected by any patents. It guarantees to all contributors in the project
   that all the contributions are original.

Contributor's agreements are standard procedure in open source projects followed
by projects ranging from the Free Software Foundation to the OpenOffice.org
project, including the Apache project, on which this agreement is loosely based.

If you are not contributing code within the framework of a company or an
institution, (i.e. your work is done as an individual), you have just to sign
the contribution agreement and send it to the gvSIG Association.

If you are a company, please ensure that someone authorised to sign on behalf of
the company signs the agreement and lists the names of people that agreements
covers. This is usually done by a senior manager in the organization. This helps
to reduce the number of individuals agreements to be signed.

If you have any question regarding this contract please contact us
